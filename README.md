 Group Presentation 
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Aim:
The aim of Assessment 1 is to present a designed structure of IT service management for an
organisation of your choice. The presentation should follow the requirement set in the assessment
criteria, be a group presentation in which each student will present part of the ITSM structure, and
follow the instructions given in the sheet as well as the instructor in the lecture/workshop.
Assessment 1: Analysis presentation on a designed ITSM for an organisation.
In this assessment, you are required to use the tools of ITSM and the guidelines of ITIL, as well
as other analysis tools such as PACT, RACI matrix, ITIL Dimensions, data visualisation, etc....
to form a professional analysis of the select organisation and design an ITSM structure of the
organisation. Each student must have a role in the assessment, which should be reflected in the
presentation time.
Once the group is set, please provide your instructor with the list of the students within the group
so the instructor can make a note of it. The submission deadline is set on the canvas page (will be
announced by the instructor) and shown at the top of the assessment sheet. After the deadline
submission, the instructor will provide you with a list of the presentation dates and locations for
each group.
Please note that the work must be presented in no longer than 15 mins (Maximum presentation
time is 15 mins, followed by a 10 mins Q&A). A timer will be set and exceeding the required
presentation time will result in a deduction of marks. A deduction will also apply if members of a
group have not attended the presentation day.
Failing to submit the presentation by the deadline or failing to attend the presentation day will
result in a zero-mark given to the group. Please make sure you are able to meet the deadlines as
no extension will be given. If there is any concern, please contact your instructor.
Deliverables:
A 15-mins presentation showing an ITSM and ITIL analysis and a designed ITSM structure for
a selected organisation. The presentation must be submitted by the deadline by all the members.
